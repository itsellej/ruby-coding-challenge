## Approach To Ruby Challenge

**Planning**
 - Read question thoroughly
 - Split up question into mini problems to approach all aspects of the question logically

**Implementation**
 - Assessed each mini problem, noting methods and methodologies I've come across which may help to solve it
 - Used Ruby docs, Stack Overflow and google if my current knowledge didn't cover this

**Testing**

 - Tested proposed solutions to assess if the results were as expected.
 - If yes, I proceeded to the next mini problem
 - If not, I revisited the mini problem and researched an alternative solution.
 - Repeated steps until the method returned expected results

**Refactoring**
 - Reading Enumerable and Ruby docs thoroughly, searching for shorter replacements for my current solutions
----------
**Note:**
 - Solution for Q14 in questions_spec.rb appears to be incorrect with a rogue quotation mark

**Incomplete questions:**
 - 30, 31, 32, 33, 34
