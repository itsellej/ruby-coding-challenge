## Approach To Ruby Challenge

**Planning**
 - Read question thoroughly
 - Split up question into mini problems to approach all aspects of the question logically

**Implementation**
 - Assessed each mini problem, noting methods and methodologies I've come across which may help to solve it
 - Used Ruby docs, Stack Overflow and google if my current knowledge didn't cover this

**Testing**

 - Tested proposed solutions to assess if the results were as expected.
 - If yes, I proceeded to the next mini problem
 - If not, I revisited the mini problem and researched an alternative solution.
 - Repeated steps until all method returned expected results

**Incomplete questions:**
